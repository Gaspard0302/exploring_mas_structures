# Project Roadmap
ðŸ§± Foundational Setup

1. Define Agent Roles and Interactions
- Hierarchical MAS: Establish a supervisor agent that delegates tasks to subordinate agents.
- Flat MAS: Design agents with equal authority, communicating peer-to-peer.
- Auction-Based MAS: Implement agents that bid for tasks, with an auctioneer managing allocations.


2. Select Appropriate Frameworks
- Mesa: Ideal for agent-based modeling and simulations.
- Spade: Supports asynchronous agent communication using the XMPP protocol.
- LangGraph: Facilitates hierarchical agent workflows with state management.
- Agentis MCP: Enables MCP integration for tool management.

3. Integrate MCP for Tool Management
- OpenAI Agents SDK: Provides MCP support for connecting agents to external tools.
- Google ADK: Offers a framework for building AI agents with MCP tool integration.

## Different MAS to build 

### A. Hierarchical MAS
Objective: Implement a supervisor agent that assigns tasks to specialized subordinate agents.
AIMultiple

Steps:

- Design the Hierarchy: Define the supervisor and subordinate agents with clear responsibilities.
- Implement Communication: Use frameworks like LangGraph or Spade to manage interactions.
- Integrate Tools via MCP: Connect agents to necessary tools using MCP servers.

Example: A supervisor agent assigns content creation to a writer agent and editing to an editor agent, coordinating the workflow.

### B. Flat MAS
Objective: Develop agents operating at the same hierarchical level, collaborating to achieve tasks.

Steps:

- Define Agent Capabilities: Ensure each agent can perform tasks independently.
- Establish Communication Protocols: Use peer-to-peer communication mechanisms.
- Tool Integration: Equip agents with necessary tools via MCP.


### C. Auction-Based MAS
Objective: Implement a system where agents bid for tasks, with an auctioneer facilitating the process.

Steps:

- Design Auction Protocol: Define bidding rules and winner selection criteria.
- Implement Agents: Develop bidder and auctioneer agents using frameworks like Spade.
- Integrate Tools via MCP: Provide agents with tools necessary for task execution.



## Possible Evalutaions / tests for the different MAS

#### 1. Cooperative Foraging

Description: Agents collect "food" items scattered in an environment and deposit them at a home base, requiring task allocation and coordination.

- **Ease: Easy** â€“ can be prototyped in Mesa within a few hours. galileo.ai
- **Interestingness: 3/5** â€“ classic benchmark for emergent collaboration but limited complexity. galileo.ai

#### 2. Search & Rescue Simulation

Description: A top-level coordinator assigns regions to scout agents; scouts report back targets (e.g., "victims") to a rescue team.

- **Ease: Medium** â€“ requires environment setup and hierarchical messaging (e.g., SPADE or LangGraph). medium.com
- **Interestingness: 5/5** â€“ tests decomposition, fault tolerance, and dynamic task reallocation. blog.spheron.network



#### 3. Distributed Sensor Coverage

Description: Peer agents position themselves to maximize coverage of an area while avoiding overlap, sharing local field data.

- **Ease: Medium** â€“ implementable in Mesa with simple P2P messaging 
galileo.ai
- **Interestingness: 4/5** â€“ highlights flat MAS strengths in decentralized information sharing 
galileo.ai


#### 4. Warehouse Order Fulfillment (Auction-Style)

Description: Delivery agents bid on "pick-and-place" tasks (orders) based on distance or capacity; an auctioneer assigns orders to highest bids.

- **Ease: Medium** â€“ bidding logic plus an auctioneer agent; can leverage Greedy Coalition Auction Algorithm (GCAA) 
arxiv.org
- **Interestingness: 5/5** â€“ realistic logistics scenario that stresses bidding strategies and dynamic reallocation

#### 5. Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF)

Description: Agents plan collision-free paths to distinct goals on a grid; performance measured by makespan or total travel time.

- **Ease: Hard** â€“ requires implementation of MAPF algorithms or auction mapping (combinatorial auctions) 
ojs.aaai.org
- **Interestingness: 5/5** â€“ rigorous test of coordination under tight constraints and algorithmic efficiency
ojs.aaai.org


#### 6. Resource Allocation via DCOP

Description: Agents jointly solve a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem, e.g., assign time slots or channels minimizing interference.

- **Ease: Hard** â€“ needs DCOP solver integration (e.g., PyDCOP) and constraint formulation 
galileo.ai
- **Interestingness: 4/5** â€“ showcases global optimization under local agent autonomy 
galileo.ai



#### 7. Dynamic Task Allocation Stress Test

Description: A continuous stream of tasks arrives unpredictably; agents must bid (auction), coordinate (flat), or follow chain-of-command (hierarchical) to process tasks.

- **Ease: Medium** â€“ builds on auction and hierarchical templates, plus task generator 
dl.acm.org
- **Interestingness: 5/5** â€“ evaluates adaptability, throughput, and robustness under load

####  8. Fault-Recovery & Resilience Drill

Description: Introduce random agent failures or misinformation; measure system's ability to detect, reassign tasks, and recover.

- **Ease: Medium** â€“ inject failure events and implement monitoring logs 
arxiv.org
- **Interestingness: 4/5** â€“ critical for real-world readiness and structural resilience
